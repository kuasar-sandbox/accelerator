# File artifacts and carriers

This specification owns the generic immutable-file encryption, tarstream and multi-Manifest Bundle contracts. Logical Manifest/Chunk objects and keys remain in [manifest.md](manifest.md); persistence/admission belongs to [store.md](store.md). It does not define Sandbox E/S contents or OCI/EROFS image semantics. Those consumers apply these carriers according to their own [sandbox artifact](https://github.com/kuasar-sandbox/sandboxer/blob/main/docs/sandbox.md#artifact-model) and [image](https://github.com/kuasar-sandbox/guest-runtime/blob/main/docs/flatten.md) contracts.

## 1. Immutable local tarstreams and encryption

A canonical plaintext tarstream contains the payload, a `.kuasar.digest.<plainDigest>` marker body and exactly two trailer blocks. Payload PAX records define its boundary; the marker body records that boundary and the payload commitment. Full reads recompute the commitment from payload bytes.

A complete carrier, or a derived source replacing only its dense metadata tail, can report identity through `CarrierDigest` without first encoding the payload into `io.Discard`. Without a codec, the public identity is `digest:<plainDigest>`. A derived dense metadata tail is limited to **64 MiB**; readers and writers share this limit and reject oversized declarations before hashing. Payload PAX/ustar transport metadata, including mode, ownership and timestamps, uses fixed canonical encoding and cannot change while retaining the same identity.

With a customer-key-backed codec, the complete structure is encoded as encrypted tarstream v1. Its public identity is exactly:

```text
hmac = HMAC-SHA256(customerKey, plainDigestRaw32Bytes)
```

The scheme is named `hmac`. It does not derive a separate identity key or add a domain prefix. The marker's plaintext digest and payload commitment remain inside ciphertext and must not be used in plaintext filenames, references, logs or errors. The physical carrier determines the identity scheme: `auto` returns `@digest` for a plaintext carrier and `@hmac` for an encrypted one, without implicit conversion.

V1 fixes **AES-256-GCM** and independently authenticated **4096-byte records**. It negotiates neither algorithm nor record size. The file comprises a **48-byte clear prefix**, an **81-byte authenticated header**, then authenticated records. Prefix bytes `[0:16]` hold magic, version, prefix size and reserved fields; `[16:48]` hold a fresh 32-byte artifact salt from `crypto/rand`. Once per artifact, the codec derives a key and constructs one AES-256-GCM instance:

```text
artifactKey = HMAC-SHA256(
  customerKey,
  "kuasar/tarstream/aes-gcm/artifact-key/v1\x00" || artifactSalt
)
```

The header uses sequence 0; data record `i` uses `i+1`. The 12-byte GCM nonce is `0x00000000 || uint64BE(sequence)`. Each wire record consists of a one-byte AES-GCM flag, ciphertext and a 16-byte tag: **17 bytes of overhead**, with no separately stored per-record nonce.

The header binds total plaintext size, packed-payload start/size and record geometry. Each record's AAD binds the complete prefix including salt, authenticated header, record index and actual plaintext length. Writing first sweeps sparse metadata and plans layout, then reads Data extents once; it does not create a plaintext staging/spool file.

Random artifact salt makes two writes of the same plaintext/customer key produce different physical ciphertext. The logical identity nevertheless remains exactly `HMAC-SHA256(customerKey, plainDigestRaw32Bytes)`, preserving the scheme, filename and logical deduplication key.

`SourceAt` reads prefix salt, binds the artifact codec, authenticates the header and suffix records covering marker/trailer, then decrypts records by index for O(1) random access. This fast path does not pre-read all data records or recompute the complete plaintext digest. Different artifacts use different derived keys, so a spliced donor record fails authentication **when that record is actually read**. A donor record outside the fast-open read set does not cause an early error.

`SourceFrom` is the full-validation path. Complete consumption decrypts every record, recomputes payload/tail commitments and carrier identity using the authoritative sparse map, and verifies the marker body, exactly two trailer blocks, expected `digest|hmac` and outer EOF. A cross-artifact record splice fails when sequential consumption reaches it.

If a caller stops early, no full-validation conclusion applies to unread data. Publishing, uploading and converting paths must consume all Data extents and propagate terminal validation errors.


## 2. Multi-Manifest Bundle carrier

Local Manifest snapshots use a standard ZIP container with ZIP64 support and a **mandatory tail index**. The current profile requires `bundle/index` directly: no legacy-format probing, unindexed compatibility or Central Directory fallback.

```text
[0]     bundle/refs                                            # optional
[0|1]   bundle/admission/<generation>/<64-lowercase-hex-salt>
[...]   chunk/<64-lowercase-hex-content-key> |
        manifest/<64-lowercase-hex-content-key>
[last]  bundle/index                                           # required

        Central Directory
        ZIP64 EOCD + locator                                   # when required
        EOCD with an empty comment
```

Manifest and Chunk payloads are the unchanged bytes of their existing physical objects. Chunk local entries are appended in the ordinal of first logical appearance in the Manifest. Only index records are sorted; the writer neither reorders Chunk payloads by ContentKey nor buffers all of them. Shared objects deduplicate by ContentKey. Manifest keys, chunk keys and physical object bytes do not change.

Every local entry uses `zip.Store`, flags 0, no data descriptor and no local extra. Comments, timestamps, permissions and platform fields are fixed. Exactly one `bundle/index` must be the final local entry; its last 256 payload bytes immediately precede the real Central Directory.

A Bundle uses no ZIP Deflate, ZIP encryption, whole-file SHA/HMAC, outer encryption, custom pack format, root entry or JSON/YAML metadata. Old `admission/*` names, old unindexed Bundles, duplicate/unknown entries, directory entries, invalid keys/admissions and truncation are rejected by the appropriate profile/verification path. Ordinary open intentionally defers some object/container checks; it is not the strict full-container verifier ([§2.4](#24-explicit-strict-verification-and-exact-upload)).

### 2.1 `bundle/index` v1

The index payload is **Chunk section, Manifest section, fixed footer**, in that order. Each section is strictly increasing by ContentKey; its partition is implicit in its section. Duplicate or unsorted keys are invalid. Every record is exactly 48 bytes, explicitly little-endian:

| Byte range | Field | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| `[0,32)` | ContentKey | Raw 32 bytes. |
| `[32,40)` | Payload DataOffset | `uint64`, absolute payload offset in the archive. |
| `[40,44)` | Payload Size | `uint32`. |
| `[44,48)` | ZIP CRC32 | `uint32`. |

DataOffset is **not** a Local Header offset. `DataOffset + Size` must use checked addition and lie entirely after the metadata prefix and before the `bundle/index` Local Header. Individual Manifest/Chunk sizes remain subject to their codec limits.

The ZIP is limited to **100,000 entries**. The two index sections together allow at most **99,998 object records**, and the index payload is bounded by **4,800,160 bytes**. Both limits apply; an optional refs entry also consumes a ZIP entry.

The footer is exactly 256 bytes. Integers are little-endian; magic and digests are raw bytes.

| Byte range | Field |
|---|---|
| `[0,16)` | Magic `KUASARBNDLINDEX1`. |
| `[16,18)` | Version, fixed at `1`. |
| `[18,20)` | Footer size, fixed at `256`. |
| `[20,22)` | Record size, fixed at `48`. |
| `[22,24)` | Reserved, all zero. |
| `[24,32)` | Absolute index-payload offset. |
| `[32,40)` | Total index-payload size. |
| `[40,48)` | Absolute `bundle/index` Local Header offset. |
| `[48,56)` | Metadata-prefix end offset. |
| `[56,64)` | Absolute Manifest-section offset. |
| `[64,72)` | Manifest record count. |
| `[72,80)` | Manifest-section size. |
| `[80,112)` | SHA-256 of exact encoded Manifest-section bytes. |
| `[112,120)` | Absolute Chunk-section offset. |
| `[120,128)` | Chunk record count. |
| `[128,136)` | Chunk-section size. |
| `[136,168)` | SHA-256 of exact encoded Chunk-section bytes. |
| `[168,252)` | Reserved, all zero. |
| `[252,256)` | CRC32C/Castagnoli of footer bytes `[0,252)`. |

Each section's size must equal exactly `count * 48`. The Chunk section starts at the index-payload beginning; the Manifest section follows immediately, followed immediately by the footer. They may neither overlap, leave gaps nor cover footer bytes.

If `directoryOffset` is the real Central Directory start declared by EOCD/ZIP64 EOCD, both equalities must hold:

```text
indexPayloadOffset + indexPayloadSize == directoryOffset
footerOffset + 256 == directoryOffset
```

Section SHA-256 and footer CRC32C detect index corruption; they are not signatures or authentication. Object-content protection follows the Manifest ContentKey, sealed key-table/decryption contract and `manifest.verify_content` policy. Chunk AES-CTR must not be described as authenticated encryption by itself.

The writer does not depend on `archive/zip.Writer`'s internal flush position. It maintains a logical `nextOffset` from canonical Local Header layout: `dataOffset = nextOffset + 30 + len(name)`. Finalize first checks the root Manifest, then sorts/encodes Chunk and Manifest records, writes the final `bundle/index`, and lets the standard ZIP writer emit Central Directory/ZIP64/EOCD. Strict verification and tests cross-check each record's offset, size and CRC against actual CD/LFH/data ranges.

### 2.2 Metadata prefix and Reader I/O

If present, `bundle/refs` must be nonempty and the first physical Local File Header. Admission follows immediately. Without refs, admission is first. The admission payload is empty.

Refs are canonical Bundle file references searched in file order, one per line:

```text
file://<basename>.bundle
file://<basename>.bundle@location:<name>
```

Refs prohibit `@manifest`, `@digest`, `@hmac`, `manifest://`, absolute paths, directory separators and filenames lacking the `.bundle` suffix. The payload must be valid UTF-8 using LF only, including a final LF. BOM, CR, empty lines, comments, surrounding whitespace and duplicate references are forbidden.

The writer preserves caller order without sorting. The limits are **1024 refs** and **1 MiB**. An empty list is represented by omitting the entry. `WriterOptions.Refs` is validated before `NewWriter` writes any byte. Refs and admission are immutable after construction; `Reader.Refs()` returns a copy.

A preflight needing only location/admission may use `OpenMetadata`/`ReadMetadata`. It validates only the contiguous Local Header metadata prefix, without reading the tail, index, Central Directory or objects. Successful prefix parsing proves neither that the Bundle is consumable nor that unindexed Bundles are supported. Actual Manifest/Chunk consumption requires `Open`/`NewReader`, which require a valid v1 index.

Ordinary `Open`/`NewReader` neither invokes `archive/zip.NewReader` nor reads Central Directory bytes, object Local Headers, the Chunk index or object payload. The remote ReaderAt opening sequence is fixed:

1. Read EOCD from EOF. For ZIP64, also read the locator and ZIP64 EOCD once each, obtaining the real directoryOffset without reading the CD bytes at that offset.
2. Read the footer at `directoryOffset - 256`; verify magic, version, checksum and all section bounds.
3. Read and verify the index entry's own canonical Local Header.
4. Read the metadata prefix contiguously using `metadataPrefixEnd`, then parse refs/admission in memory.
5. Read the complete Manifest section once, validate its digest, sort order, uniqueness, sizes and ranges, and build an O(1) read-only lookup map. Leave the Chunk section unread.

Thus the specified ZIP32 ReaderAt open uses **five fixed range reads**; ZIP64 uses **seven**. The count does not grow with Chunk count. Local file opening prefers read-only mmap. The ReaderAt object-payload fallback uses a bounded per-Reader buffer pool with 4 KiB–2 MiB size classes and at most **32 MiB retained**.

### 2.3 Source selection, Chunk preparation and ordinary restore

A Bundle can hold the root memory Manifest, current root/data-disk layer Manifests and, when needed, incorporated parent-layer Manifests. All objects share the complete `store.WriteAdmission` recorded in the admission entry. The caller obtains one admission before constructing `bundle.Writer`; subsequent Ingest calls read that fixed value. Shared chunks are written once per ContentKey.

Chunk encoding can run concurrently, but bounded ordinal reordering waits for logical order and appends ZIP bytes serially, avoiding an unbounded completion queue.

`Config.NewBundleIngester` connects the writer to the configured ingest path without extra salt for compatibility. `Config.NewBundleIngesterWithExtraSalt` accepts the same optional extra-salt resolver as Store ingest. The Bundle records the base admission, while each actual Chunk key is authenticated in the encrypted Manifest key table. Full verification and exact upload therefore decrypt with the authenticated key and do not attempt to derive it again from the base admission salt; readers never need the extra salt. Physical ContentKeys, the key-table AAD, decoded sizes, layout, closure, and the target admission are still verified before the root is published.

`manifest-ctl load --output-mode=bundle` is the executable producer for this
profile. Its positional inputs are layered top-to-bottom; a file reference of
the form `file://NAME.bundle@manifest:KEY[@location:NAME]` selects and proves a
root in that Bundle. `--ref-location NAME=file:///absolute/directory` keeps
host paths out of persistent references. Tail stripping/replacement is applied
to the selected logical stream, not to this outer ZIP carrier.

The read side chooses a source **only at `Fetcher.OpenManifest`**, in this order:

```text
current Bundle → bundle/refs[0] → bundle/refs[1] → ... → default remote Cache/Store
```

A caller-supplied `bundle.SourceResolver` resolves paths and locations. Accelerator consumes canonical references already validated by the Reader. A resolver may return `ErrSourceUnavailable` for a missing sibling, missing location mapping or missing located file. Source selection has not completed yet, so diagnostics may be retained while search continues. A present file with a corrupt profile/ZIP must return an ordinary error and fail closed. A referenced Bundle's own Refs are not recursively searched; the creator must flatten the search list.

| Manifest source | Getter for its Manifest and chunks | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Current Bundle or first refs Bundle containing the key. | That Bundle only. | Chunk-index, object-read, parse or decrypt errors fail directly; no further search. |
| All Bundles cleanly miss or are unavailable. | Remote cache/store only. | Coincidentally matching chunks in other Bundles are not used. |

There is no per-object fallback Getter mixing Bundles. A corrupt local Manifest does not cause a retry from another Bundle or Store. Current/refs source selection only queries the Manifest maps loaded at Open; a clean miss does not read a Chunk section.

Once a Bundle is selected, its Reader loads the entire Chunk section contiguously **before returning a Stream**, validates its digest/records/ranges and builds an O(1) immutable map. Preparation serializes concurrent loaders and caches only a successful validated index; after failure or cancellation, later calls can load it again. A remote source has no Bundle Reader and skips this preparation.

After preparation, Manifest/Chunk Get uses the record's payload DataOffset/Size for one target-payload range read, without rereading the index, object Local Header or Central Directory. The Stream's first data read therefore does not pay an O(Chunk-record-count) initialization cost.

An external root selector must use `OpenRootManifest`/`SelectRoot` to prove that the root physically exists in the **current Bundle**. It may not obtain the root indirectly from refs or Store.

Ordinary restore does **not** pre-scan the Manifest's complete chunk closure. A Manifest may name a missing chunk that the current workload never reads: Open/OpenManifest can succeed and present chunks remain readable. The missing chunk fails only when actually accessed, with no source fallback after selection.

`manifest.verify_content=false` does not implicitly trigger physical SHA scans. When enabled, the Manifest and Chunk physical hashes and key-table authentication are checked according to the normal read contract. Neither case makes ordinary lazy restore equivalent to a complete availability verification.

### 2.4 Explicit strict verification and exact upload

Single-Bundle full verify/upload and multi-source `VerifyExactManifests`/`UploadExactManifests` first run an explicit container verifier, regardless of `manifest.verify_content`.

It reads the complete Central Directory and, in its original order, checks every Local Header, name, method, flags, timestamp, attributes, extras, size, CRC and contiguous data range. This proves there are no reordered, hidden, overlapping or gapped entries. It requires the index to be the sole final entry and cross-checks every Manifest/Chunk record against CD/LFH/data ranges, rejecting unindexed objects, index references to nonexistent objects and extra metadata. Ordinary Open/Get does not perform these O(entry-count) checks.

Strict paths then verify the full closure and object content. A missing but unaccessed chunk fails FullVerify immediately; exact upload fails before any Put. Multi-source exact upload follows this order:

1. The caller selects the current/refs Bundle for each logical Manifest key at OpenManifest level. Dependencies already strictly verified in the destination Store do not enter the Bundle upload plan.
2. Before any admission or Put, run the complete CD/LFH/index container verifier on every actual source in that plan.
3. Before any Put, call `AdmitWriteFor(recorded.Generation)` for all actual source admissions. Returned Generation and Salt must match the recorded bytes exactly.
4. Force verification of every selected Manifest's physical ContentKey, parse it, unseal its table with the customer key, and prove its entire chunk closure resides in that same source Bundle. Before any Put, reject one ContentKey associated with inconsistent keys or plaintext sizes across Manifests.
5. Concurrent workers process every actually used unique chunk in each source: force physical ContentKey verification, decrypt/decompress with the authenticated key-table key, validate the decoded length, then Put that verified physical chunk. The actual keys already include any writer-side extra salt. This is per-chunk verify-then-upload, not a global plaintext-verification barrier.
6. Only after all chunk workers succeed, upload dependency Manifests and publish the caller-specified current root last. A later chunk verification or upload failure can leave earlier verified chunks in Store, but prevents publication of the root.

Each object uses its source Bundle's recorded admission. Upload neither redirects objects to the newest generation nor rechunks, recompresses, re-encrypts, reseals the table or rewrites upper-level `snapshot.cfg`. Root ManifestKey and physical bytes remain unchanged. Failure in admission preflight, dependency verification or Put prevents final root publication. Refs and admission entries are container metadata, not Store objects, and are not uploaded.

FullVerify also rejects chunks unreferenced by any local Manifest. After parsing snapshot-specific metadata, the caller can supply `ExpectedManifests` as the exact locally reachable Manifest set, rejecting unrelated Manifests without making accelerator interpret `snapshot.cfg`.

Read error classification, random-access failure and recovery are specified in [§4](#4-read-errors-random-access-and-recovery).

## 3. Shared suffix-ZIP handling

`pkg/tailzip` is the format-neutral implementation for a ZIP appended to logical
image bytes. `Locate(io.ReaderAt, size, Options)` returns the payload boundary
and suffix length, `Read` returns a bounded copy for extraction, `Prefix`
exposes the unchanged sparse payload, and `Append` composes a validated suffix
while retaining Hole, explicit Zero, and Data runs in the payload. These
operations apply to logical image bytes, never to an outer Manifest Bundle.

The default profile accepts ZIP trailers produced by existing image writers and
limits both the suffix and its decoded entry total to 64 MiB. Callers with a protocol schema can set entry-count,
known-entry, order, and STORED-method requirements. Locating requires an EOCD
which ends exactly at logical EOF, rejects multi-disk and unsupported ZIP64
suffixes, checks integer and central-directory bounds through `archive/zip`, and
reads every entry to verify its CRC. Absence is distinguishable with
`tailzip.ErrNotFound`; a recognizable malformed or truncated archive is an
error rather than an absent tail.

`pkg/image.AppendConfigZip`, `ReadConfig`, and `ReadConfigFromFile` use this
common mechanism. The writer retains the historical deterministic entry name,
STORED method, timestamp and byte layout, while readers continue to accept the
supported image ZIP profile. Both `flatten.Build` and `flatten.BuildFromDir`
therefore produce their trailers through `pkg/tailzip` indirectly and all image
config reads share the same payload-boundary implementation.


### Shared readers, writers and strict profiles

`pkg/manifest/transfer.Reader` opens the selected logical source and retains source ownership and verification. `transfer.Write` accepts a sparse source plus `WriteOptions`; its `BeforeCommit` hook completes caller-owned source/output validation before the Store root is emitted. `manifest.RefLocations` supplies the shared validated location mapping used by manifest-ctl and sandboxer.

`tailzip.ReadCanonical` and `EncodeCanonical` implement the fixed raw-header profile used by S/E; `ReadFooter` and `Names` provide bounded geometry and role-detection metadata. Application modules supply ordered entry names, size limits and their config/schema validation. `tailzip.Section` preserves borrowed run lifetimes and unchanged prefix ChunkRun capabilities; `Append` preserves the authoritative payload boundary and compatible digest commitments.

The image reader/writer, both flatten builders, flatten-ctl packing, sandboxer S/E readers/builders and their image assembly/capture/restore callers share these helpers. Image ZIP bytes retain their existing writer profile; S/E keep their strict profile. New image tarstream envelopes declare the EROFS prefix as payload and the config ZIP as metadata tail. Existing carriers remain readable under their original identity declarations.

Suffix ZIP processing checks the EOCD entry count and bounded directory geometry before constructing the ZIP reader. Local offsets are relative to the suffix; absolute-prefix archives are rejected rather than treating payload as metadata. Full ReaderAt buffers accompanied by ordinary EOF are accepted. Short reads and marked source failures remain errors.

Canonical footer/name/body readers explicitly accept io.ReaderAt and a logical size. Their footer-first access requires genuine random access; monotone sparse sources use the sequential transfer path. Canonical encoding rejects ZIP64 entry counts before output. Complete bounded suffix reads retain backend failures even when the returned buffer is full.

## 4. Read errors, random access and recovery

Accelerator immutable readers perform one attempt and leave business retry/backoff to their consumer. `pkg/readerr.Mark(err, retryable)` preserves `Error()`/`Unwrap()` and adds only `Retryable() bool`; marking nil returns nil. Unknown errors are not confirmed permanent failures. Permanent semantic causes remain visible through wrappers and joined errors, and a marker at a semantic boundary is authoritative for its wrapped branch. Normal end-of-object EOF and confirmed absence retain their existing interfaces; required immutable lookup converts confirmed absence into a permanent cause. Validated format/range/integrity/authentication failures are marked where that meaning is known, while network EOF, partial frame/stream, backend-local cancellation and opaque access/decode errors retain their causes unless actual validation proves corruption.

A fixed-size `ReaderAt` request is one attempt. Short-nil results and real truncation of declared fields are structural failures, not permission to append a second response. Ordinary complete EOF remains valid where the source contract allows it; bare `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` remains structural even with a full buffer. Explicit source failures are preserved before EOF compatibility handling, and the random-access metadata adapter must not let `io.ReadFull` hide a full buffer accompanied by a source failure. Sequential sources retain one-pass semantics rather than acquiring replay. `sparse.Dense` advances by bytes actually consumed while filling a request even when the read fails; rereading an earlier offset is rejected instead of returning following bytes for the failed range.

Parallel range reads join every worker before returning, including cancellation paths. The original failure is retained, derived sibling cancellation cannot replace it, and another worker's permanent cause remains in the aggregate. No worker may keep writing the caller's buffer after return. Existing Hole/Zero/Data streaming semantics stay unchanged.

Direct CLI immutable reads report their single-attempt error to the command owner. No retry setting, fallback source, health mask, service restart or compatibility mode is introduced by this contract. Tests cover partial frame/stream cleanup, initialization recovery, source isolation, joined permanent errors and worker lifetime; end-to-end retry policy remains consumer-owned.
